# TheChirperToggler
A mod for Cities: Skyline to toggle 'chirper' on and off
* Adds a Toggle button to turn Chirper on and off
* Messages are not deleted while off, allowing you to always read what you miss
* A reposition button to allow you to reposition the button where you want (simply drag and drop)
* Saves the on/off state and position to remain persistent between play sessions
